            </p>
            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              So in short (and probably wrong according to one or another
              definition):
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>
              Lean is a concept/philosophy on how to organise and run a company
              <strong>efficient</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              Lean defines <strong>efficient</strong> as the reduction of
              <strong>waste</strong> in a process that generates customer value
              and thus money.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              Waste is a flaw in this process and can be any number of things:
              unreasonable work, transportations, waiting, overproduction,
              defects, ...
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>
              Lean establishes a company culture, that actively explores the
              processes, scans for waste and introduces continous processes to
              reduce this waste.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              Lean includes all persons involved in the value generating process
              and especially relies on the workers mostly involved with the
              process.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              This has some implications on how a lean company should be
              managed, since a top-down hierarchical "i say, you do" culture
              contradicts lean processes.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Why is lean so important?</h3>

            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              There are a handfull of definitions, dozens of big expensive books
              and thousands of very expensive consultants that will explain you
              "Lean"
            </p>
            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              Lean applies to all kinds of companies and many big players became
              big because of lean thinking (Toyota).
            </p>
            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              A small IT startup can use lean and a 100 year old manufacturer as
              well.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              Lean is a structural different way of structuring and organising a
              company, but it has it payoffs -> focus on customer value &
              reduction of waste.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Lean and agile?</h3>

            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              Lean is a bit older than agile - some say lean methods inspired
              the foundation of agile and some even say: if you go agile your
              also going lean.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              And the goals of both are to a high degree identical.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              However agile focuses on __delivering a finished product__, while
              lean focuses on __reduction of waste__. This (tiny) difference
              leads to some operational differences.

            <h2>Kanban</h2>
            Kanban is one method that is often used within lean organisations.
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How does Kanban work?</h3>

            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              A board with three (sometimes more columns): Open, Work in
              Progress, Done
            </p>
            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              A task is placed in Open and moves from left to right. When it
              reaches Done it's done. And regular meetings with the team where
              the content of the board and it's progress is discussed.

            Easy to grasp visualisation of Open work, work in progress and Done
            tasks. Because of this comprehensiveness the team can easily see
            what it is currently doing, what they already achieved and what
            liesahead of them. -> You always know where you currently stand! It
            also allows discussion on the task at hand - that need to be done
            next ->Focus.

            One can find such cases even without Kanban, but with Kanban it
            becomes visible.

            <p class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out">
              (Imagine: daily Kanban meetings and the above scenario occures
              several days per week. The question: what slows you down? is
              answered several times with the same answer. Suddenly everybody in
              the team realises the limitation.)
